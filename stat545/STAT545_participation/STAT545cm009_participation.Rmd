## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Reading and Writing Data: Exercises

Make a tibble of letters, their order in the alphabet, and then a pasting of the two columns together.

```{r}
tibble(let = letters,
       num = 1:length(letters),
       comb = paste(let, num))
```

Make a tibble of three names and commute times.

```{r}
tribble(
  ~name, ~time,
  "Fran", 30,
  "Tina", 15,
  "Gerald", 40
)
```


Write the `iris` data frame as a `csv`. 

```{r}
write_csv(iris, "iris.csv")
```

Write the `iris` data frame to a file delimited by a dollar sign. 

```{r}
write_delim(iris, "iris.txt", delim = "$")
```

Read the dollar-delimited `iris` data to a tibble.

```{r}
read_delim("iris.txt", delim = "$")
```

Read these three LOTR csv's, saving them to `lotr1`, `lotr2`, and `lotr3`:

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Two_Towers.csv
- https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/data/The_Return_Of_The_King.csv

```{r}
lotr1<- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Fellowship_Of_The_Ring.csv")
lotr2<- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Two_Towers.csv")
lotr3<- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/The_Return_Of_The_King.csv")
```

## `gather()`

(Exercises largely based off of Jenny Bryan's [gather tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/02-gather.md))

This function is useful for making untidy data tidy (so that computers can more easily crunch the numbers).

1. Combine the three LOTR untidy tables (`lotr1`, `lotr2`, `lotr3`) to a single untidy table by stacking them.  

```{r}
(lotr_untidy<- bind_rows(lotr1, lotr2, lotr3))
```

2. Convert to tidy. Also try this by specifying columns as a range, and with the `contains()` function.

```{r}
gather(lotr_untidy, key = "Gender", value = "Word", Female, Male)
gather(lotr_untidy, key = "Gender", value = "Word", Female:Male)
gather(lotr_untidy, key = "Gender", value = "Word", contains("ale"))
```

3. Try again (bind and tidy the three untidy data frames), but without knowing how many tables there are originally. 
    - The additional work here does not require any additional tools from the tidyverse, but instead uses a `do.call` from base R -- a useful tool in data analysis when the number of "items" is variable/unknown, or quite large. 

```{r}
lotr_list<- list(lotr1, lotr2, lotr3)
lotr_list
do.call(bind_rows, lotr_list)
```

## `spread()`

(Exercises largely based off of Jenny Bryan's [spread tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/03-spread.md))

This function is useful for making tidy data untidy (to be more pleasing to the eye).

Read in the tidy LOTR data (despite having just made it):

```{r}
lotr_tidy <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/master/data/lotr_tidy.csv")
```

Get word counts across "Race". Then try "Gender". 

```{r}
spread(lotr_tidy, key = "Race", value = "Words")
```

Now try combining race and gender. Use `unite()` from `tidyr` instead of `paste()`. 

```{r}
lotr_tidy %>%
  unite(Race_Gender, Race, Gender) %>%
  spread(key = "Race_Gender", value = "Words")
```

## Other `tidyr` goodies

Check out the Examples in the documentation to explore the following.

`expand` vs `complete` (trim vs keep everything). Together with `nesting`. Check out the Examples in the `expand` documentation.

```{r}
expand(mtcars, vs, cyl)
```

`separate_rows`: useful when you have a variable number of entries in a "cell".

```{r}

```

`unite` and `separate`.

```{r}

```

`uncount` (as the opposite of `dplyr::count()`)

```{r}
df <- tibble::tibble(x = c("a", "b"), n = c(1, 2))
uncount(df, n)
uncount(df, n, .id = "id")
```


`drop_na` and `replace_na`

```{r}


```

`fill`

```{r}

```


`full_seq`

```{r}

```


## Time remaining?

Time permitting, do [this exercise](https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy/blob/master/02-gather.md#exercises) to practice tidying data.
